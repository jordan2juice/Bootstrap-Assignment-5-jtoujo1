# Instructions  

## Introduction

You will re-do your original restaurant website with Bootstrap. Please start all over! Don't copy and paste your code! If you copy and paste, you might end up taking extra time hunting for bugs.

The greatest challenge in this assigment will be keeping track of all the tags--opening and closing. So, run your code at every step.

Optional: You are encouraged to use Git to save your coding history. Try and `commit` at least 3 times, preferably more during your process. 

Note: If you wish to make a whole new design, with a new topic, that is OK too.

### Requirements

1. Have a wireframe that you made in Canva.com, or another design program
2. Edit the README.md file so that it uses your information. Display your own wireframe image in the README.
4.  3 pages: Home, Menu, About
5. Navbar on each page
6. Use `container` classes on every page. (This should be on the parent of your content.)
7. Use row and col classes in your `menu.html` page. (You may use them on the other pages too.)
8. Have at least 3 pictures of food for your Menu page.
9. Use a `list-group` somewhere.
10. Use at least one other Component, for example, a [card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/)
11. Use at least three utility classes, for example [spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/), [sizing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/sizing/), or [text](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/text/)
12. Have some sort of Nav at the top of each page. It could be `breadcrumb` or `navbar`
